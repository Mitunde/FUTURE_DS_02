# Overview
This project was carried out during my internship to analyze the performance of multiple advertising campaigns. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contained details such as campaign IDs, demographics, interests, impressions, clicks, spend, and conversions.

The primary goal was to evaluate how well the ad campaigns performed, identify the most effective campaign, and provide actionable recommendations for future marketing decisions.
Microsoft Excel → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploration.
Power BI → Visualization and dashboard creation for insights presentation

## Key Insights
- Higher impressions did not always translate into higher conversions, highlighting the importance of audience targeting.
- Certain interests were consistently associated with better engagement and conversions.
- Spending efficiency (cost per conversion) varied, with some campaigns delivering more value for money.
-  Campaign performance varied significantly across demographics.

## Stakeholder Questions Answered
# How well did the ad campaign perform?
Overall, the campaign performance is mixed—high visibility but financially inefficient.

- Reach & Awareness (Excellent): The campaigns delivered massive visibility with 213 Million Impressions.

- Conversion Rate (Good): The overall conversion rate is 8.55%, which is a healthy baseline for social media ads.

- Financial Efficiency (Critical Failure): The campaign has an ROI (Return on Investment) of -98.2%. This indicates that for every dollar spent, the campaign is not generating enough attributed revenue to cover the cost. This is largely driven by high spending on inefficient segments (like the 45-49 age group and the "(Blank)" campaign).

#  Which campaign_id had the highest impressions?
- The highest volume of impressions came from the (Blank) campaign category, likely representing untracked or general spend. Among the specific, tracked Campaign IDs, Campaign 1178 was the highest.

- Campaign (Blank): ~135 Million Impressions

- Campaign 1178: ~70 Million Impressions

- Comparison: Campaign 936 had ~8M and Campaign 916 had ~483K.

# Which campaign_id had the highest interest?
- "Interest" (likely a metric for engagement, such as likes or saves) follows a similar pattern, with the untracked campaign leading, followed by Campaign 936.

- Campaign (Blank): 57K Interest

- Campaign 936: 38K Interest

- Campaign 1178: 21K Interest

- Campaign 916: 4K Interest

# Which campaign_id had the highest CTR (Click-Through Rate)?
Campaign 936 had the highest Click-Through Rate, making it the most effective at driving traffic relative to its impressions.

- Campaign 936: ~0.025% (1,984 clicks / 8M impressions)

- Campaign 916: ~0.023% (113 clicks / 483K impressions)

- Campaign (Blank): ~0.019% (26K clicks / 135M impressions)

- Campaign 1178: ~0.013% (9,577 clicks / 70M impressions)

While Campaign 1178 is getting the most eyeballs (Impressions), Campaign 936 is generating more actual interest and clicks per view, suggesting its content is more resonant with the audience.

##  Recommendations
- Test Creatives: Experiment with different ad formats and messaging to improve engagement.
- Monitor Interest Segments: Track which interests consistently generate conversions and double down on them.
- Refine Targeting: Focus on audience segments with proven higher conversion rates.
- Optimize Spend: Reallocate budget from low-performing campaigns to those with better ROI.

## Conclusion 
Your campaigns are effective at generating interest (Impressions/Clicks) but inefficient at closing the deal (ROI). You have a "diamond in the rough" with Campaign 916 and the 30-34 demographic. By cutting the "Blank" campaign waste and moving money to these high-performers, you can likely flip the ROI from negative to positive without spending an extra dollar.
